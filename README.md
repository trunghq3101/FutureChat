# Future Chat
An in-progress personal Android app to experience new technologies, implement best practices, optimize code and architecture

Here is how I will write this project:

### Case 1: If I face a new component, library or technology

+ Step 1: I will try to implement it first to understand it and know how to use it right
+ Step 2: Write test
+ Step 3: Refactor to make code to be clean and reusable

### Case 2: If it's something I familiar, I will follow TDD (Write test first)

### Case 3: After having deep understand, I will refactor to optimize performance

At the moment, this project is including:
- Multi-module structure
- Clean Architecture (by www.raywenderlich.com)
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Firebase Authentication
- Navigation Component
- Paging (with database + network)
- Room Database

## To-do list:
- Handle unused Tokens of FCM
- Check Google Play Service availability
- Firebase functions to sanitize user input
